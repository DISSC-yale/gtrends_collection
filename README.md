# Google Trends Collection Framework

This is in part a simple Python package to handle collection from the Google Trends beta research API,
and a minimal framework to organize historical and continuous collection.

## Data

A selection of data are collected in the [data](data) directory, and are updated weekly.

The selection is defined by the files in the [scope](scope) directory.

### Local Use

To work with the data locally, you can clone this repository:

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/DISSC-yale/gtrends_collection.git
```

Then load the data in Python:

```python
from pyarrow.dataset import dataset

data = dataset("gtrends_collection/data").to_table().to_pandas()
```

or R:

```R
library(arrow)

data <- open_dataset("gtrends_collection/data") |> dplyr::collect()
```

### Collection

The [scripts/historical_collection.py](scripts/historical_collection.py) script is used to collect full histories
based on the scope files:

```sh
python scripts/historical_collection.py
```

The [scripts/weekly_collection.py](scripts/weekly_collection.py) script is used by the GitHub Actions workflow
to add new data each week.

The [scripts/add_terms.py](scripts/add_terms.py) script can be used to add and collect new terms:

```sh
python scripts/add_terms.py "term, another term"
```

Any topic or category terms should also be manually added to [scope/term_map.csv](scope/term_map.csv).

#### Authentication

A developer key is required to collect from the beta API.

This can either be set to the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable,
or stored in an `.env` file:

```sh
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AlphanumericKey
```

## Rebuilding

### Scripts

Some scripts are used to build parts of the repository.

#### Summary

The [scipts/build_summary.py](scipts/build_summary.py) script creates [docs_source/Data.md](docs_source/Data.md):

```sh
python scripts/build_summary.py
```

#### Metadata

The [scipts/build_metadata.py](scipts/build_metadata.py) script creates [scope/locations.txt](scope/locations.txt):

```sh
python scripts/build_metadata.py
```

### Hatch

[Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io) is used to manage package testing:

```sh
hatch run test
```

And building of the documentation site:

```sh
hatch run docs:build
```
